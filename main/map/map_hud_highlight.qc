Overview: 
  HUD Highlighting is a map event sent to chosen clients. This creates a colored box around a portion of the player's screen
  for a set amount of time. The use case is primarily for information and training purposes, but can be useful in other ways.

  MESSAGE_ONLY will just send a special event to show an info box;
  
-------- KEYS -------- 
.movedir = <vector> [screen position] - X\Y coords on client screen to draw box, given in %'s 0.001 - 1.0
.compOffset = <vector> [box size] - X\Y size of box to be drawn, given in %'s 0.001 - 1.0
.color = <vector> [red, green, blue] - color of the box
.faction = <float> [faction] - OPTIONAL - use with .spawnflags[8]
.data_lifetime = <float> [time to draw] - amount of time to draw box for

.target = <string> [ent] - fire this trigger when done
.wait = <float> [cooldown] - how long to wait before reactivating, spawnflags[64]

-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
START_OFF 1: will start as deactivated
ON_TOUCH 2: will react to being touched by a players
REMOVE_FINISH 4: will be removed when finished playing
FACTION_ONLY 8: only reacts to this faction
DROPTOFLOOR 16: object drops to floor for easier touch possibility
FREEZE_PLAYER 32: any players that trigger the Animatic are frozen in place
COOLDOWN 64: use .wait
CALL_BY_TRIGGER 128: must be used with START_OFF
MESSAGE_ONLY 256: only sends message as INFO box
