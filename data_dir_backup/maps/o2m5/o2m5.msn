//'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | | [I.Varaci] Yes, we are falling back. Our stock is empty, the server exchanges are burning ruins... | | [L.Gavir] I take it your last offensive failed? | | [I.Varaci] very badly. We`re down to just our METALS, and the techs can barely keep them together on-the-run. | | [L.Gavir] make your way to Ark-Province, maybe we can work together to get the starport facilities operational again. | | [I.Varaci] That`s a big if. MILITAR and Survest armies fought over that sector for months before we both levelled it with indiscriminate bombing runs. | | [L.Gavir] This war appeared straightforward when Royal Command decided to launch strikes at you all, now everything is destroyed...Ach, what`s done is done. | | [I.Varaci] We thought we understood the costs of war - our short sighted view has damned us. | | <SIGNAL LOST>'
  'brief' : 'It appears the enemy has one more offensive to throw before they retreat from this theater. | | The bulk of PSC forces have been deployed elsewhere to mop up the last areas of resistance, mostly just unarmed enemy groups. | | You, DEAD_HAND, are tasked with protecting this flank of our deployment zone. | | Success here will finally push the hostile invaders back to the terminus region that they initially attacked. '
  'intel' : 'Militar forces have broken through this sector, threatening one of our main bases with capture or destruction. | | Multiple waves of enemies approaching near designated (NAV) points. | | Enemy force composition appears to be armored fighting vehicles moving in first and <Metal> units closing in behind them. | | (OMICRON) is the main point of contact and you should move there first. | | There is a bridge across the chasm near our base that is useable for navigating around the canyon. | | Our base is equipped with a [Repair Bay] that you can take advantage of.'
