//'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | [Investen Varaci] I do not believe House Gavir was being underhanded on this. Their refugees that CNINE Corp. has allowed across the border have corroborated the reports. | | [CEO.Wilkins] The stories match the situation that our own corporations have seen on the edges of our territory. | The shareholders have voted to activate more of our liquid reserves to the Mercenary Guilds... | | [I.Varaci] This may not be enough, get in touch with the crypto-trusts and consider extending credit to the fleeing Survest houses. | <L.Gavir> and <L.Yunver> can be persuaded to aid us. | | [CEO.Wilkins] Affirmative, I`ll send a notice to Finance now. Anything else? | | [I.Varaci] I am meeting with <L.Gavir> tomorrow as well, he says he has some ideas on what exactly we are fighting. | | [CEO.Wilkins] Understood, I await your update. | | <TRANSMISSION LOST>'
  'brief' : 'PSC has an emergency situation for you, DEAD_HAND. | | PSC is still moving its active forces into position for our assault on the <GLACIAN EDGE> half of the planet. Enemy has re-organized faster than we anticipated and has uncovered one of our surface-level operating bases. Losing this base will give the enemy too much time to strengthen their lines. | | We are sending you in to our closest underground rail delivery node. Reach the base and begin a combat sweep of the surrounding zone. | | Eliminate hostile formations at each nav and make sure the base stays mostly intact.'
  'intel' : '!ALERT! | + Cryo-stasis failure in Storage-Deeps Facility 3. + Effective Strike force from this facility; 5% of maximum... + Enemy forces are closing in and this firebase must still be defended. | | Recommended Strike Package; 1x Monitor class | | Enemy is dispersed through out the AO, heavy mix of tanks and <METALS>.'
