//'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | [L.Gavir] I told you it would not be enough. Each of these pale METALS fights with the skill and ferocity of a squadron of our units... | | [I.Varaci] I am painfully aware of this information, thank you very much. | What can you do about it? | | [L.Gavir] From what I have salvaged from my family archives, there may be some critical knowledge about these...things that we can locate. | | [I.Varaci] that`s it!? | | [L.Gavir] what else do you want? the disection reports? the scant salvage we have collected? My House and most others have been wiped out. All of our Starport zones are destroyed too. We are fleeing into the lands of our once-allies, now hated enemies.. | | [I.Varaci] Ok, ok. I apologize, these are extreme times we find ourselves in and I failed to appreciate it more. I have paid a transport service to bring you to my villa higher up in the Glacis Strata. | I will assist your mission as I can... | | <TRANSMISSION LOST>'
  'brief' : 'Interesting developments have occurred since your last mission. | | SIGINT has determined that enemy command elements have deployed near the front. Best estimate is that the enemy forces need stiffened resolve and this old tactic is being brought out. | | PSC is very unsure why invader forces are using our peoples` call-signs and units, the chance of surprise is long gone... | | '
  'intel' : 'DEAD_HAND forces have achieved an opening in the Enemy`s defense line. | | We are tasking you with crippling their leadership before they can evacuate. | | Find the VIP targets in this zone, and eliminate them with extreme prejudice. | | Recommended Strike Package; | 1x Monitor METAL | OR | 1x Matok METAL'
