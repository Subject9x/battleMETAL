//'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | [Lord Gavir] Ok barons, lets check the damage, what are we looking at? | | [SRV.OFC] Hab-Block 19 base reporting in; all quiet since yesterday, we`re at 63% casualties. | | [L.Gavir] -sigh- That bad, well how about the Militar garrison? | | [SRV.OFC] They appear to be in similar straits, I sent out a patrol to keep tabs on them. | | [L.Gavir] Good enough, I`m rebuilding Royal Command with survivors, but your orders for now are to start salvaging equipment in the city. Anything else? | | [SRV.OFC] Understood my Lord, there is one other thing - a few listening posts have picked up heavily encrypted radio signals coming from the Deep Wastes. One <METAL> squad also reported flares about 8 kliks out from our position. Certain key hashes matched this...`PSC` series of radio bands? | | [L.Gavir] That...name... I may have heard something about it years ago. Something about early-warning systems in case of planetary invasion <snort>. Just keep an eye or two on it for now, probably a nuke-triggered malfunction. | | [SRV.OFC] roger, my lord, ending comm. | <TRANSMISSION LOST>'
  'brief' : 'Perimeter System Control brought online on <${date corrupted}>. | | Following boot protocol 4.3A, PSC will begin assessment of planetary defense grid and assets. | | Immediate Action; deployment of fast-response DEAD_HANDS to secure and activate follow-on units. | | Initial sensor sweeps indicate the planet is completely overrun with invaders. | | Attempts to contact Planetary Defense Command have gone unanswered, PSC assumes command has been destroyed during the invasion.'
  'intel' : 'PSC lacks necessary data to provide accurate prediction models for weapons and equipment. | | PSC recommends lightest possible metal node to reduce material risk at this crucial juncture. | | Engaging Hostile Forces is not advised at this time.'
