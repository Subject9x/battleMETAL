//'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | [Mercenary] We agree to those terms, <Varaci>. Though I find your initial stock-offering to be a little suspicious. | | [I.Varaci] I need your free-blades to cover this hole in our defenses, other corporations have outbid us on 4 of the previous merc contracts, I wanted to make sure we got the best with our money. | | [Merc] Fair trade, we`ll deploy throughout the warehouse and contractor-housing areas in the Basalt Jags. I think we can handle a few worthless METALs that wander in. | | [I.Varaci] for what my CFO greenlit for funds, you`d better. These `phantom` METALS have been marauding everywhere in past few months, they even were able to put most SURVEST Royal houses out of...well existence. | | [Merc] Petty nobles and their serf warriors are no match for elite Mercs like us, we live-and-die on our paychecks so you can have confidence in our fighting capabilities. | | [I.Varaci] Contract approved, the Board eagerly awaits your aftermatch reports... | | <TRANSMISSION LOST>'
  'brief' : 'PSC has the invaders on the back-foot now. With their assault formations decimated, they have attempted to scout out other locations of our firebases. | | While they are distracted, PSC will send you into the heart of a local enemy complex. | | Scans indicate the hostile forces are occupying our people`s original hab-blocks and warehouses. | | Intel is still trying to understand why an enemy would make this specific mistake. | | Regardless, our mission remains the same; deny the planet to the Enemy, make them pay for invading.'
  'intel' : 'Enemy Base Area divided into specific zones. | | Base defenses compromise METAL squadrons reinforced by AFVs. | | Enemy forces are on high alert and will respond to each of your attacks. | | Recommended Strike Package; 1x Monitor METAL.'
