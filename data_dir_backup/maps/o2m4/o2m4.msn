  'brief' : '-COMM INTERCEPT- | [L.Gavir] Still in one piece? | | [I.Varaci] I....yes...but... Wilkins, Lucre... they`re all dead... | | [L.Gavir] I`m...sorry...Our convoys will be linking up in a few hours. I`ve assembled whats left of my Royal House guards. | | [I.Varaci] Right, I no longer have funds to pay for anything, however some of the remaining mercenaries have realized that cash won`t matter in a few weeks. | | [L.Gavir] <sigh> yes, I have a NAV we`ll be headed to in advance of the refugee columns. At this point it`s got more radiation but buried in the rubble are some ancient data warehouses. | | [I.Varaci] Going over your previous notes, you do not believe this is an outside attack? | | [L.Gavir] No, my studies point to something we may have made... | | [I.Varaci] Impossible, to what end would these creatures...exist? My Strategists have pointed out these things aren`t building anything new. The enemy seems to burn or capture everything it reaches! | | [L.Gavir] Just make it to the rendevous. | | <TRANSMISSION LOST>'
  'intel' : 'Enemy has retreated to several strongpoints closer to the Terminus. | | Headhunter units have been assigned to knock out all enemy convoys. | | You, however, have a higher purpose. | | Your record is commendable. | | You shall raze this following strongpoint to the ground. | | This should force the enemy to flee back to our resurrected units on STORMSIDE... | | Recommended Strike Package; <N\A> you have proven you know what you are doing.'
